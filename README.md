# LithiumCraft
LithiumCraft is a realistic but challenging modpack for Minecraft which makes realism to your Minecraft world.

Since LithiumCraft was released recently, it may have some issues with mods and possibly crash your game.

Please note that this modpack is for experienced players as it's challenging and possibly hard. If you are a beginner at Minecraft and wanted this modpack, it's not recommended but you can install it anyway.
